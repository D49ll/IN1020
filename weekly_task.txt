# Assembly code written fro LMC

#Write a program that adds 3 numbers. 

    INP     //Input from user to be stored accumulator register
    STA 99  //Save input from accumulator register in DAT 99
    INP     //Next input to be stored in acc.register
    ADD 99  //Add accumulator value with value from DAT 99
    STA 99  //Store this value in DAT 99
    INP     //New input
    ADD 99  //Add accumulator value with value from DAT 99
    OUT     //Print value from accumulator
    HLT     //STOP 

#Write a program that doubles the value from input and prints input

    INP     //INPUT TO acc
    STA 99  //STORE acc
    ADD 99  //ADD acc with stored value
    OUT     //Print value from acc
